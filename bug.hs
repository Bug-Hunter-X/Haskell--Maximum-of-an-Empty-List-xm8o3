This Haskell code attempts to use the `maximum` function on an empty list, leading to a runtime error.  Specifically, it tries to find the maximum element in a list of integers, but if the list is empty, `maximum` throws an exception.
```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
  let emptyList = [] :: [Int]
  let maxVal = maximum emptyList
  print maxVal
```
