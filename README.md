This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Haskell: applying the `maximum` function to an empty list.  The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to find the maximum element of an empty integer list. This results in a runtime exception. The solution, provided in `bugSolution.hs`, addresses this issue by using pattern matching or the `maybe` function to handle the case of an empty list gracefully.
